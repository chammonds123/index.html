<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Cherokee Hammonds and I am in my last semester at Lewis. I was on the Women's Golf Team here at Lewis for my first 3 years. I moved to Chicago 4 years ago from a small town in rural Kentucky. Some of my family still resides in Kentucky while the rest of my family is scattered all over the world, as many never moved to the states or are in the military. My major is Aviation Administration with a minor in Arabic Language. I plan to attend join the Air Force and attend officer school following graduation.</p>
<h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
<p><ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square"></ul>
    <li>A basic understanding of Java, Python, and HTML.</li>
    <li>How to problem solve when I am faced with technical difficulties.</li>
    <li>The ability to create a webpage.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h3>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h3>
  <p>I have quite a few hobbies as I have always been a very active person. My biggest hobby would have to be golf, as I played in college. I still enjoy working around and being a part of the game. I recently was lucky enough to be apart of the Pro Liv Golf event here in Chicago this past weekend. I have made many connections and friendships through the game of golf that I will forever be so thankful for.</p>
  <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
  <p>A fun fact about myself would be that I have lived in 9 different states. </p>
